# nnn-themes

In your terminal, test the themes by setting the following environment variables; basically, just copy and paste it and then open **nnn**.

After you decided one permanently, just set it in your **rc** shell, for example, append the line in **~/.bashrc** for bash or **~/.zshrc** for zsh.
